I chose to go with Disqus, it was the one you recommended and well I have to say it did work without a hitch, implementation took maybe two minutes. I'm
impressed by that still that is an accomplishment of disqus, not jekyll. Just like good plugins for wordpress aren't a success for wordpress but for the
authors of those plugins.

{% if page.comments %}
<div id="disqus_thread"></div>
<script>

var disqus_config = function () {
this.page.url = PAGE_URL;  // Replace PAGE_URL with your page's canonical URL variable
this.page.identifier = PAGE_IDENTIFIER; // Replace PAGE_IDENTIFIER with your page's unique identifier variable
};
*/
(function() { // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
s.src = 'https://examination-1-1.disqus.com/embed.js';
s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());
(d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
})();
